# Eye-tracking causality #

This repository contains materials of the project Eye-tracking Causality. Please contact [me](mailto:tger@mit.edu)  in case you have any questions. 

## Figures ##

This folder contains all the figures from the paper plus additional figures. 

### Diagrams ###

- Diagrams of the 18 test clips that were shown to participants in the experiment. 

### Plots ###

- Data plots shown in the paper and additional plots not shown in the paper. 

### Screenshots ###

- Screenshots of the instructions 

## Videos ##

This folder contains different videos, showing just the clips, participants' eye-movements, the Hidden Markov Model, and an example for how the model classifies a participants' looks. 

### Clips ###

- 18 test clips and 2 practice clips. 

### Tracking ###

- Clips showing each participants' eye-movements, organized by experimental condition. 
- Note: The participant numbers 

### HMM ###

- Clips that show how the Hidden Markov Model's classification regions change over time. 

### Classification ###

- Shows how the looks are classified for one example participant (Participant 1 in the causal condition)
- The label at the top of the screen indicates what state the model believes that the participant is in (using a Viterbi algorithm as described in the paper)

## Code ##

This folder contains the experiment and analysis code. 

### Experiment code ###

- Code to run the experiment in MATLAB using the Psychophysics toolbox 

### Analysis code ###

- Code to run the analysis and make plots in R
